# File-Folder-Modification
Taking a static list of IDs and comparing them to a folder with a large amount of files. When a file is matched with one of the static IDs the file is then moved into another folder for organization. Once the files are in the folder the program iterates over all the files in the new folder and changes the file extension based on the description found inside the file.
